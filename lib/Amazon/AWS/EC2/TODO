+ See about writing a spider that goes here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html
  And generates the reset of these?

  This should ONLY be considered after the type verification test has been written. See the obj-testing branch for the status on that initiative.
  update (cw): ... Oops... I forgot this prerequisite.

- Modify Utils::populateTestObject to honor Attribute WHY comments.
- Add a switch to object tests in t/ to limit testing to a specific object
- Regarding using Type objects in Actions and Filters, it may be best to smartmatch
  objects against Amazon::AWS::EC2::Types::Base, and then using dynamic lookup
  to special case. The default case would be whatever is appropriate for that filter,
  which would usually be the object-id for the main type in question.

  This may mean more complex logic in validation, although the above strategy
  could be used to keep it as clean as possible.
- Write script to test new actions. Would work like the basic test-new, except
  would only key on new Action classes. From there it would test corresponding
  Action, Response and Filter objects. Depends on completion of previous action
  item.
- t/03-filter.t -- First test returns a false positive. Investigate why and solve.
