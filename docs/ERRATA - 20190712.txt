√ DescribeInstances
    + Filter object was misnamed. Fixed and retested for verification.
- DescribeVolumeModifications (The action DescribeVolumeModifications is not valid for this web service.)
    + It is not yet known what the proper fix for this is!
√ DescribeSecurityGroups (not ok 5 - Response object is the correct type.)
    + Looks to be an error with the test harness. This works fine:
    
      perl6 -Ilib -e \
        'use Amazon::AWS::EC2::Action::DescribeSecurityGroups;          \
        my $x = DescribeSecurityGroups.new.run(:raw);                   \
        use Amazon::AWS::EC2::Response::DescribeSecurityGroupsResponse; \ 
        DescribeSecurityGroupsResponse.from-xml($x).gist.say
    + Had to remove dynamic loading, altogether to get this to work. FYI, This
      is the pure form of the test. This should ALWAYS work. The tests so far
      have been written with abstraction in mind. Maybe someone will come up 
      with something better. Could pass the types to an abstracted sub, maybe?
    
- DescribePublicIpv4Pools (Bail out! #3 failed, so no further tests needed)
    - This is a dynamic loading issue that does not seem to want to be solved.
- DescribePrincipalIdFormat (Same as above)
- DeleteNetworkInterface (Most recently written, see DescribePublicIpv4Pools)
